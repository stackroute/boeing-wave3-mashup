This library\nsupports full STOMP specifications and all current protocol variants. Most\npopular messaging brokers support STOMP and STOMP over WebSockets either natively\nor using plugins.\n\nIn general JavaScript engines in browsers are not friendly to binary protocols,\nso using STOMP is a good option because it is a text oriented protocol.\n\nThis library has its roots in a version released by [Jeff Mesnil](http://jmesnil.net/).\n\n## Current Status\n\nVersion 5 of this library has been bottom up rewritten using TypeScript (versions 3/4\nuse CoffeeScript). The code has substantially changed, so, while there is a compatibility\nmode, you might need to update your code.\n\nThis library is feature complete and has been used in production for many years. It\nis actively maintained. You are welcome to file issues and submit pull requests.\n\n## Upgrading\n\nif you were using an older version of this library, you would need to make changes\nto your code. Head to\n[Upgrading](https://stomp-js.github.io/guide/stompjs/2018/09/08/upgrading-stompjs.html)\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe API documentation is hosted as GitHub pages for entire StompJS family of libraries.\nYou may head straight to the https://stomp-js.github.io/api-docs/latest/\n\nThis library comes with detailed usage instructions. Please find it at \n[Usage instructions](https://stomp-js.github.io/guide/stompjs/2018/06/28/using-stompjs-v5.html).\nCheck out other guides at https://stomp-js.github.io/.\n\nThere are quite detailed API documentation,\nyou should start at https://stomp-js.github.io/api-docs/latest/classes/Client.html.\n\n## Usage with RxJS\n\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/rx-stomp is based on this library and exposes the entire functionality\noffered by this library as rxjs Observables.\n\n## Usage with Angular2/4/5/6/7\n\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng2-stompjs is based on https://github.com/stomp-js/rx-stomp \nand exposes key classes as Angular Injectable Services.\n\n## TypeScript definitions\n\nThe npm package includes TypeScript definitions, so there is no need no install it separately.\n\n## Change log\n\nPlease visit [Change Log](Change-log.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you want to understand the code, develop, or contribute. Please visit\n[How to contribute](Contribute.md). \n\n## Authors\n\n * [Jeff Mesnil](http://jmesnil.net/)\n * [Jeff Lindsay](http://github.com/progrium)\n * [Vanessa Williams](http://github.com/fridgebuzz)\n * [Deepak Kumar](https://github.com/kum-deepak)\n * Astha Deep\n * [Dillon Sellars](https://github.com/dillon-sellars)\n * [Jimi Charalampidis](https://github.com/jimic)\n * [Raul](https://github.com/rulonder)\n\n## License\n\n[License](LICENSE.md) - Apache v2 License\n",
